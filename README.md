# Skip Selector Component

## Description

For the sake of continuity, I chose to recreate the steps leading up to the page I needed to modify.

After a few iterations, I arrived at this current design, where the focus is on clarity and user experience. I decided not to display the same image for every skip, as it added no real value. Instead, I emphasized a clean and intuitive structure that highlights the most relevant information â€” skip size and price.

## What the component does

- Displays a list of skips.
- Allows the user to select a skip.
- Provides additional details via a per-item dropdown.

## Technologies used

- React
- SCSS
